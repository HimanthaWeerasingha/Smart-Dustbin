# Smart-Dustbin
This is an assembly language-based project. This smart dustbin is based on a microcontroller-based system and features ultrasonic sensors, stepper motors, a display, and a battery on the dustbin. Assembly programming language is used to program the microcontrollers to fulfill these tasks.
the sensor interfacing with ATMEGA328P microcontroller can be built at low cost.
